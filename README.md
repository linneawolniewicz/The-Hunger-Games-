# The Hunger Games

This is a choose-your-own adventure style game run from the command line. 
In this game, you may choose to create a character from the Hunger Games or to create your own. Characters begin with different skills and equipment.
Once you have created your character, you may move around the board landing on tiles that may contain puzzles, other characters, or equipment.
When you run into other players you may choose to fight them or to run away from them, however the game only ends when you are the last player standing!

I hope you enjoy! I had a lot of fun building this game in C++.

To play the game, open all the files in a coding environment with a C++ compiler such as VSCode. Then, run them through the command line by typing:
> g++ driver.cpp character.cpp equipment.cpp game.cpp map.cpp -o hungerGames

> ./hungerGames
